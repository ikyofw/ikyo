## Download

Go to the Python official website: <https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/>

In the download list, select the Windows platform installation package. The
package format is python-XYZ.msi, where XYZ is the version number to install.

Once downloaded, double-click on the package to enter the Python installation
wizard. The installation is very simple; use the default settings and keep
clicking "Next" until the installation is complete.

## Setting Environment Variables

Right-click on "Computer" and click "Properties".

Then click "Advanced System Settings".

Select "Path" in the "System Variables" window, and double-click it.

In the "Path" line, add the Python installation path (for example,
D:\Python32). Paths are separated by semicolons.

  
After successfully setting the environment variables, open the command prompt
(cmd) and enter the command python. If the relevant Python prompt appears, the
setup is successful.
